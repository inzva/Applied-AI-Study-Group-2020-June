Welcome to inzva Applied AI Study Group! 

We will investigate upon the fields in AI such as computer vision, NLP, anomaly detection and traditional machine learning. We will use various types of architectures, such as artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks and embedding layers. In addition, we will use a variety of frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and system ml.

In this week’s module, we will cover some concepts about computer vision and start working with classification, localization and segmentation problems, using MNIST, CIFAR10 and Kaggle Facial Keypoint Detection datasets.

1- In this notebook, we do classification in MNIST dataset, using TensorFlow and artificial neural networks. We talk about TensorFlow concepts such as sessions and placeholder objects. We use Google Colab as our computing platform.

2- In this notebook, we do classification in MNIST dataset, just like the first notebook.  We also talk about TensorBoard, TensorFlow’s visualization toolkit. This time we use Keras functional API and convolutional neural networks as our method. We discuss Keras concepts such as model objects and methods of model objects. We use Google Colab as our computing platform.

3- In this notebook, we do classification in CIFAR10 dataset. As our method, we use Keras sequential API and convolutional neural networks. We explain theoretical concepts behind convolutional neural networks, such as pooling and convolution processes, then talk about other concepts including normalization layers and activation functions. We use Google Colab as our computing platform.

4, 5 - In these notebooks we perform key point localization (also called key point detection) on Kaggle Facial Key Point Detection Dataset, using Keras sequential API and convolutional neural networks. We use Google Colab as our computing platform. Moreover, we mention some preprocessing and visualization (plotting) tricks.

Finally, we perform key point detection on the same dataset using PyTorch. We talk about calculating input output shapes in convolutional neural networks. Fair warning, we actually failed in this notebook! We couldn’t run the code with Batch Normalization layers included, and without them, our network was not able to learn the task. If you solved this, reach us on how you solved it!

6 - In this notebook we use a pretrained pytorch ResNet-101 model to do segmentation. We segmented a bird image and a landscape image to test our model.
